AI-Driven Cyber Threat Detection and Profiling Using NLP — Repository Description

This project implements an AI-driven cyber-threat detection and profiling system using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The application analyzes cybersecurity-related text (such as incident reports, logs, and threat intelligence data) to automatically identify, classify, and profile emerging cyber threats. Built with Django, the system provides separate dashboards for service providers and remote users, enabling real-time monitoring, visualization, and management of detected threats.

Key features include:

Automated extraction of cyber-threat patterns using NLP & text mining

Threat classification and profiling for emerging attack trends

Secure user authentication with role-based access (Service Provider / Remote User)

Integrated SQL database for storing reports and predictions

Web-based interface for uploading and analyzing textual data

Tech Stack:

Python, Django

NLP / Machine Learning libraries

SQL Database

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (frontend)

This project is designed for academic research, cybersecurity analytics prototyping, and AI-assisted threat intelligence exploration.
